# Brave Personal Certificates on Linux

I think this used to be harder, but it's actually pretty easy as of writing
this. Just go to <brave://certificate-manager/clientcerts>, select 'View
Imported certificates from Linux', and then 'Import', and then you can simply
select a `.p12` file, enter the password, and you're done.
